# inSky

inSky is a user-driven web app that provides the ability for users to find the best flight deals for their travels. inSky is dynamic, intuitive, and user friendly. 
 
Simply enter the desired travel dates, the city (or cities) to be visited and inSky will do the rest. Once inSky has the information needed from the API, a trip itinerary and detailed information about pricing are provided. If a user finds a particularly great deal, they can continue onto the airlineâ€™s website for easy booking.
